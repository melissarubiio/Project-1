# Weather-Cats
## Check your local weather, get happy and motivated!

Everyone needs a little pick-me-up from time to time and that is something that cats on the internet can definitely deliver. We saw an opportunity to combine that with the local weather and famous quotes to help people leave their house a little bit happier. Weather-Cats is an easy-to-use, straightforard application that delivers data to the user in a format that they can view simply whether they are on a desktop or using their smartphone. 

A major aspect of this project was learning how collaborate with other developers to come together to achieve a goal using the tools that GitHub provides. We used branches to create different parts of the website and merged them together in Melissa's project repository.
